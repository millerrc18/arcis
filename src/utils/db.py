"""SQLite / PostgreSQL connection helper.

Called by: scheduler.watch, shadow_trading.executor, sync.render_sync, and others
Calls: none
Owns tables: none
Config keys: DATABASE_URL (optional — if set and starts with 'postgres', uses PG)
Tests: tests/test_db_util.py

When DATABASE_URL is unset (or empty), connect_db() returns a plain
sqlite3.Connection against DEFAULT_DB, exactly as before this change.  When
DATABASE_URL starts with 'postgres', connect_db() (called with no db_path)
returns a PostgresConnectionWrapper backed by psycopg2.  When an explicit
db_path is passed the SQLite path is ALWAYS used, preserving test-fixture
compatibility for the 336 callers that use init_test_db(db_path).

The busy_timeout is critical because multiple threads (watch loop, sync thread,
FastAPI workers) all access the same SQLite database file — and external tools
(MS Access, DB Browser, etc.) can hold the file lock for indefinite durations
while the operator inspects data. Without it, a thread that tries to write
while another transaction holds the lock gets an immediate "database is
locked" error.

Prior timeout was 5s, which was insufficient to ride through external-tool
locks (observed 2026-04-19: 118 "database is locked" errors in arcis.log,
concentrated during a window where the operator had the DB open in MS Access).
30s gives enough slack to span most interactive inspections without
compromising trading-critical paths, which normally write in <100ms.

Row factory is set to sqlite3.Row globally so that results are accessible by
column name (dict-like) rather than tuple index. This prevents bugs when columns
are reordered in the schema registry.
