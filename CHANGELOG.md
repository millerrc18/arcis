# Changelog

## [Unreleased] — IB Structural Fixes (Sprint IB-2)

### Critical Runtime Bug Fixes

- **fix:** `get_live_broker()` called without config arg — TypeError on live path
- **fix:** `get_positions()` → `get_all_positions()` + `p["symbol"]` → `p.ticker`
- **fix:** IB bracket child order IDs now stored (enables bracket health monitoring)
- **fix:** Bracket exit monitoring routes through broker factory for live trades
- **fix:** `_retry_exit` cancel uses broker factory for live/IB trades
- **fix:** Risk governor uses IB account equity when `broker=ib`
- **fix:** Live reconciler cancels IB orders before closing stale trades
- **fix:** IB `get_position` fetches current price via market data snapshot
- **fix:** Startup check validates `ib_async` availability when IB configured

### Schema

- Added `ib_child_order_ids` column to `shadow_trades`
- Added `broker_order_id` alias column (prep for `alpaca_order_id` migration)

## [Unreleased] — IB Test Coverage + Shadow Mode (#368)

### IB Broker Unit Tests (24 tests)

- **test:** Full unit test coverage for all 10 `BrokerAdapter` methods on `IBBroker`
  via mock factories (no ib_async dependency required). Covers happy paths (10),
  error handling (8), and edge cases (6) — connection lifecycle, bracket orders,
  market orders, exits, cancellations, positions, price snapshots.
- **test:** Mock factory helpers in `tests/conftest_ib.py` for all 6 ib_async
  object types (AccountValue, Trade, Position, Order, Stock, Ticker).

### IB Shadow Mode

- **feat:** `IBShadowLogger` class (`src/trading/ib_shadow.py`) — validates IB
  Gateway connectivity, contract validity, and buying power for each Alpaca
  trade WITHOUT submitting orders. Stores comparison data in `ib_shadow_log`.
- **schema:** Added `ib_shadow_log` table (17 columns, sync_to_postgres=False).
- **feat:** Executor hooks in `open_shadow_trade()` and `open_live_trade()` —
  non-blocking, wrapped in try/except, only fires when `ib.shadow_mode: true`.
- **test:** 6 shadow logger tests + 2 executor integration tests.

## [v0.16.12] - 2026-04-11

### Trading safety + security batch (#361, #363, #369, #370, #380)

**Trading safety (#369, #370):**
- **fix:** Replaced 6 `except Exception: pass` blocks in `executor.py` with
  `logger.warning()` — critical trading notifications (buying-power crisis,
  unprotected positions, exit circuit breaker) were silently swallowed
- **fix:** Added argument validation to `test_retry_exit_called_for_exit_failed`
  (`assert_called_once_with` instead of `assert_called_once`)
- **fix:** Added explicit assertion to `test_missing_table_does_not_raise`

**Security (#361, #363, #380):**
- **fix:** Added column allowlist in `attribution/logger.py` — dynamic SQL
  SET clause now validates columns against `_ALLOWED_ATTRIBUTION_COLUMNS`
- **fix:** Replaced `.format()` SQL in `value_tracker.py` with parameterized
  `?` placeholders for the `IN` clause
- **fix:** Replaced raw `str(exc)` in 5 command executor error responses with
  generic error categories — full details logged server-side only

## [v0.16.11] - 2026-04-11

### Fix: Test regressions — buying power mock + training gate assertion (#239, #371, #372)

- **fix:** Added `get_account_info` mock to `TestPaperSourceTagging` and
  `TestDualExecution` — tests failed because `_check_paper_buying_power()`
  returns $1 with placeholder API keys (#371, #239)
- **fix:** Updated `test_markdown_bold_heading_rejected` to use a standalone
  bold heading line (`**Market context:**\n`) instead of inline bold-then-text.
  The regex was intentionally narrowed in #334 to allow inline emphasis; the
  test wasn't updated (#372)
- **fix:** Fixed `test_daily_loss_guard_halts_trading` — the daily loss guard
  queries the DB directly, not `get_open_shadow_trades`. Test now inserts a
  losing live trade into tmp_db so the guard finds it.
- **fix:** Fixed `test_generate_create_sql_basic` — SQLite generator inlines
  `PRIMARY KEY` on single INTEGER columns (ROWID alias). Test was asserting
  the separate `PRIMARY KEY (id)` constraint form.

## [v0.16.10] - 2026-04-11

### P2 batch: research feeds, CBOE scraper, buying power race condition (#389-392)

- **fix:** Research feeds (#389): Removed dead Anthropic `/feed.xml` (404) and
  OpenAI `/blog/rss/` (403) URLs. Replaced Anthropic with `/research/rss.xml`.
  Added `Accept` header to SSRN request. Increased arXiv timeout to 60s.
- **fix:** CBOE scraper (#390): Demoted regex-failure log from `warning` to
  `debug` — the SPY proxy and FRED fallbacks already produce reliable data.
  The regex breaks every time CBOE changes their HTML.
- **note:** NULL ids (#391): Investigated and confirmed already resolved —
  SQLite `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` auto-assigns ROWIDs. Current state: 459K rows,
  0 NULL ids. The auto-repair messages in logs were from a one-time migration.
- **fix:** Buying power race condition (#392): Added per-scan-cycle committed
  capital tracker in executor. Previously N trades each passed the buying power
  check individually but together exhausted capital. Now
  `_scan_cycle_committed` subtracts capital from earlier orders in the same
  batch before checking. Reset at scan start via `reset_scan_cycle_committed()`.

## [v0.16.9] - 2026-04-11

### Root cause gap closures for #383, #386, #388

- **fix:** Added `_coerce_to_schema` to `update_recommendation()` — was unprotected
- **fix:** Refactored direct SQL UPDATE in `executor.py:650` to use
  `update_shadow_trade()` — was bypassing the coercion write boundary
- **fix:** Council dynamic weights: aggregate net PnL per day before joining
  to votes, preventing many-to-many inflation where 1 vote × 5 trades = 5
  data points. Added `session_type` filter to the query.
- **fix:** Applied circuit breaker to `generate_structured()` — was unprotected
  against Ollama outages, burning 180s timeouts independently of `generate()`

## [v0.16.8] - 2026-04-11

### Hotfix: Ollama timeout resilience — circuit breaker + auto-restart (#388)

- **fix:** Added consecutive failure tracking (circuit breaker) to `generate()` —
  after 3 failures, skips immediately instead of burning 180s timeouts per call.
  Previously 15 consecutive timeouts wasted 45 minutes on Apr 10 evening.
- **fix:** Auto-restart mechanism: when circuit breaker trips, attempts to restart
  Ollama via `ollama serve` before giving up
- **fix:** 2-second cooldown between inference calls to prevent Ollama overload
  during batch processing (10-20 tickers per scan cycle)

## [v0.16.7] - 2026-04-11

### Hotfix: Training pipeline — em-dash SyntaxError + GGUF fallback + Modelfile path (#387)

- **fix:** Replaced Unicode em-dash with ASCII `--` in `training_data/train.py:78`
  — Windows cp1252 subprocess could not parse the UTF-8 character, blocking
  the entire training script from loading
- **fix:** Added CPU-based GGUF conversion fallback via llama.cpp when Unsloth
  GPU export fails due to insufficient VRAM (RTX 3060 12GB)
- **fix:** Modelfile path now uses `.as_posix()` for forward slashes — was
  writing Windows backslashes into the `FROM` directive

## [v0.16.6] - 2026-04-11

### Hotfix: Council dynamic weights query — fix broken join (#386)

- **fix:** Replaced broken `JOIN shadow_trades st ON cs.session_id = st.session_id`
  (column never existed) with date-based join `ON date(cs.created_at) = date(st.created_at)`.
  Council sessions are market-level, not per-trade — votes are matched to trades
  opened on the same day.
- **fix:** Added `float()` cast on `pnl_dollars` comparison (defense-in-depth for #383)

## [v0.16.5] - 2026-04-11

### Hotfix: Auto-fix Postgres schema drift during startup (#385)

- **fix:** Startup sequence now runs `create_all_tables()` + `ensure_columns()`
  against Render Postgres automatically, matching the SQLite auto-fix pattern.
  Previously only warned about drift (filed 8 times as #184, #285, #307, #331,
  #332, #338). Missing tables and columns are now created on every startup.

## [v0.16.4] - 2026-04-11

### Hotfix: LLM output quality — repeat penalty + output validation (#384)

- **fix:** Added `repeat_penalty: 1.15` to Ollama API calls in `src/llm/client.py`
  to suppress degenerate repetition loops (52 debug log files showed `===` or
  data fields repeated 10-82 times)
- **fix:** Added `_validate_llm_output()` pre-parser in `src/llm/packet_writer.py`
  that rejects responses containing prompt leakage (37% of debug logs), template
  stubs (10%), and repetition loops (14%) before they reach the XML parser
- **test:** 10 tests for `_validate_llm_output` covering all rejection categories

## [v0.16.3] - 2026-04-11

### Hotfix: Write-boundary type coercion for shadow_trades (#383)

- **fix:** Added `_coerce_to_schema()` to `src/journal/store.py` — coerces dict
  values to match schema registry column types (REAL→float, INTEGER→int) before
  INSERT/UPDATE. Applied to `insert_shadow_trade()`, `update_shadow_trade()`,
  and `log_recommendation()`. This is the systemic root cause behind 10+ prior
  issues where `pnl_dollars`, `entry_price`, `price_at_recommendation` etc.
  were stored as strings, causing TypeErrors in 8+ downstream subsystems.
- **test:** 13 tests for `_coerce_to_schema` covering string→float, None
  preservation, unknown tables/columns, invalid values, and multi-column
  coercion.

## [Unreleased] — Manual Backfill Pipeline

### Historical Backfill: Manual Generation Workflow

**New modules:**
- `src/training/regime_sampler.py` — regime-targeted date selection, stratified sampling, FRED macro formatting, and dataset balancing helpers (moved from backfill.py)
- `scripts/export_backfill_prompts.py` — exports regime-targeted prompt files with real FRED macro context for manual generation via Claude/ChatGPT
- `scripts/import_backfill_results.py` — validates XML, pairs with sealed outcomes, inserts into training_examples (idempotent)
- `scripts/backfill_progress.py` — visual per-regime progress tracker

**Enhancements:**
- `src/training/historical_data.py` — FRED historical series fetch (`fetch_fred_history`) + point-in-time lookup (`get_fred_value_as_of`)
- `src/training/historical_scanner.py` — FRED macro enrichment in scan pipeline, PASS example generation (score 45-69), `generate_backfill_example()` handles outcome=None
- `src/llm/prompts.py` — `PASS_ANALYSIS_PROMPT` for below-threshold setups (conviction 1-4, NEUTRAL direction)

**Refactors:**
- `src/training/backfill.py` — 445→343 lines; `_balance_dataset`, `_deduplicate_candidates`, `_cap_and_diversify` moved to `regime_sampler.py`

**Tests:** 16 new tests (6 FRED history + 10 regime sampler); all 40 pass

## [v0.16.2] - 2026-04-11

### Hotfix: MR scan broken import (#382)

- **fix:** Corrected import path `src.journal.recommendation_logger` →
  `src.journal.store` — the `recommendation_logger` module never existed;
  `log_recommendation()` lives in `store.py`. Mean-reversion scanning has been
  fully disabled since April 9.

## [v0.16.1] - 2026-04-10

### Hotfix: pandas 3.0 import deadlock on Windows

- **fix:** Pin `pandas>=2.2,<3.0` in requirements.txt — pandas 3.0.1 C extensions
  deadlock on import under Python 3.13 + Windows (DLL loading hang in
  `pandas._libs.pandas_parser`)
- **fix:** Recreate venv with pandas 2.2.3 to restore `startup` / watch loop

## [v0.14.0] - 2026-04-05

### Interactive Brokers Integration — Broker Abstraction Layer

5 new files, 19 new tests. Multi-broker architecture deployed.

**New modules:**
- `src/trading/broker_interface.py` — Abstract BrokerAdapter (10 methods) + normalized dataclasses
- `src/trading/broker_factory.py` — Singleton factory, config-driven routing (`"ib" | "alpaca"`)
- `src/trading/ib_broker.py` — IB adapter via ib_async, lazy connection, GTC bracket orders
- `src/trading/alpaca_broker.py` — Thin wrapper over existing alpaca_adapter.py
- `tests/test_broker_interface.py` — 19 tests (interface compliance, factory routing, dataclasses)

**Architecture changes:**
- Live trading routes through broker factory: `get_live_broker(config)` instead of direct Alpaca
- Schema: `broker` column added to `shadow_trades` (default "alpaca")
- Config: `settings.example.yaml` updated with IB settings (host, port, client_id)
- Paper trading unchanged (Alpaca direct, no abstraction needed)
