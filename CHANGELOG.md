# Changelog

## [Unreleased] - 2026-03-27/29

### Weekend Mega Sprint (4 sprints: Stabilize + Hotfix + Build + Document)

#### Critical Safety Fixes
- Fixed: safety checks fail closed on errors, not open (#42)
- Fixed: journal closes after broker confirmation, not before (#41)
- Fixed: LLM validator accepts the real `TradePacket` schema (#40)
- Fixed: paper trades are logged as `failed` on submission failure instead of phantom opens (#46)
- Fixed: `/shadow/close` now requires broker exit semantics for Alpaca-backed trades (#45)
- Fixed: council data gatherers query the correct live column names (#44)
- Fixed: Telegram trade notifications use the real packet fields and source labels (#48)
- Fixed: kill-switch tests and training-ingestion tests now run deterministically against the hardened runtime behavior

#### New Features
- Added: event calendar 0-10 continuous risk scoring with sizing multipliers and Telegram alerts
- Added: bracket order health monitor with intraday, pre-market, and post-close verification
- Added: optional GBNF grammar enforcement path for XML commentary generation
- Added: data quality ingestion gates with duplicate detection and batch halt alerts
- Added: Notes page plus cloud CRUD API for pinned, tagged operator notes
- Added: Council.jsx v2 with new agent identities, consensus labels, strategic prompt input, and parameter adjustment history
- Added: HSHS radar chart and live phase-weight display on the Health page

#### Infrastructure
- Added: `scripts/verify_counts.py` for AGENTS.md count verification
- Added: `scripts/schema_report.py` for canonical SQLite schema reporting
- Added: `scripts/generate_dependency_graph.py` and generated `docs/dependency-graph.md`
- Added: `scripts/render_architecture_doc.py` to regenerate the architecture inventory from live code
- Added: strategy-specific pullback timeout support (15 -> 7 days)
- Added: Render sync coverage for the new notes data path
- Added: `bracket_health` and `user_notes` tables to the working schema
- Fixed: SQLite connection handling in earnings enrichment (#52)
- Fixed: kill-switch path handling so safety remains configurable without leaking ambient state into tests (#47)
- Removed: stale council v1 compatibility wrappers from active code paths

#### Documentation
- Added: 11 architecture decision records under `docs/decisions/`
- Rewrote: `docs/architecture.md` from the live module, route, and schema inventories
- Rewrote: `docs/roadmap.md` to consolidate the confirmed March 28-29, 2026 decisions
- Added: `docs/observation-log-template.md` for the Monday-through-Sunday operating rhythm
- Updated: Framework v2.1 research integration notes for risk budgeting, EDGAR fundamentals, operating cadence, and fund-path deferrals
- Documented: council prompt caching was evaluated and intentionally not enabled because the current agent prompts do not share a reusable long prefix

## 2026-03-28 — Reliability Sprint + Research-Informed Features

### Critical Safety Fixes
- Risk governor REJECTS trades on exception (was: approve anyway)
- Drawdown returns 15% conservative estimate on error (was: 0%)

### New Features
- **Traffic Light regime:** VIX(20/30) + 200-DMA(3%) + credit spread(0.5σ/1.5σ) → sizing multiplier. 5-day persistence filter.
- **PEAD enrichment:** 5 earnings signals in pullback prompt (conditional on proximity ≤30 days)
- **Implementation Shortfall:** Signal price capture, IS computation on fill, rolling 20-trade alert
- **HSHS live:** 5-dimension health score from database, wired into CTO report + council + API
- **System validator:** 50+ checks, Validation dashboard page
- Independent live trade monitoring (source_filter parameter)

### Research & Architecture
- 6 new research documents (35 total), all strategy decisions confirmed

## 2026-03-27 — Dashboard Hardening + Email Digests

### Error Visibility (Part A)
- Every `except Exception` block in cloud_app.py now has `logger.error()` with endpoint name and exc_info
- Every error response now includes an `"error"` key with the exception message
- New `/api/diagnostics` endpoint tests all 23 dashboard tables and reports pass/fail per table

### Test Coverage (Part B)
- Added 29 new cloud API tests covering all previously untested endpoints
- Coverage: activity feed, live trades/summary, council session detail, health score dimensions, settings, market overview, data asset growth, journal, signal zoo, macro dashboard, research papers/digest, training quality, scan metrics, projections, diagnostics, reconcile, CTO report shape
- Total cloud API tests: 67 (up from 38)

### Email Digests (Part C)

## 2026-03-27 — Live Trade Reconciliation

### New Features
- **`reconcile-live` CLI Command** — Detects orphaned Alpaca positions (on broker but not in DB) and stale DB records (in DB but not on broker); backfills or marks closed with `--dry-run` option
- **Live Ledger Reconcile Button** — Disabled button with tooltip showing CLI command for local execution

### Fixes
- **Fractional Shares** — `get_live_positions()`, `get_all_positions()`, `get_position()` in alpaca_adapter now use `float(qty)` instead of `int(qty)` to support fractional share positions

### Backend
- New `POST /api/live/reconcile` endpoint (returns cloud_mode error — local CLI only)
- New `src/shadow_trading/reconcile.py` module with `reconcile_live_trades()` function

### Tests
- 5 new tests: dry-run safety, orphan backfill, stale marking, no-discrepancy, paper-trade isolation
